# python project template :information_desk_person:

This is a highly opinionated template for Python projects that provides a solid foundation for building modern Python applications with best practices and modern tooling.

> **Note:** This project has been tested and verified only on macOS. While it may work on other operating systems, we cannot guarantee full compatibility.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.10 or higher

- [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) - Fast Python package installer
- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) - Command runner
- Docker and Docker Compose - For containerization

## Quick Start

1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the [repository](https://github.com/talgat-abdraimov/python-project-template).

2. Above the file list, click **Use this template**.

3. Select **Create a new repository**.

4. Type a name for your repository, and an optional description.

5. Click **Create repository from template**.

6. Wait about **20 seconds** then refresh this page. [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) will automatically update the README.md.

7. Clone your locally created repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com/{your-new-repo}.git
   ```
   Then open the project in your favorite IDE.

8. Install the package installer [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):
   ```bash
   pip install uv
   ```

9. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   uv venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS
   # or
   .venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows
   ```

10. Install development dependencies:
    ```bash
    just dev-deps
    ```

11. Build the Docker container:
    ```bash
    just build
    ```

12. Start the application:
    ```bash
    just up
    ```

## Development Tools

### just

Just is a command runner that simplifies running project commands. You can install it using your package manager:

- macOS: `brew install just`
- Linux: `sudo apt-get install just` or equivalent for your distribution
- Windows: `choco install just` or `scoop install just`

### pre-commit

Before you can run hooks, you must have the pre-commit package manager installed. It helps maintain code quality by running checks before each commit.

### ruff

Ruff aims to be significantly faster than alternative tools while integrating more functionality behind a single, common interface. It's used for linting and formatting Python code.

[see more](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/)

### pytest

The pytest framework makes it easy to write small, readable tests, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

[see more](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.4.x/)

### uv

An extremely fast Python package installer and resolver, written in Rust. Designed as a drop-in replacement for common pip and pip-tools workflows.
